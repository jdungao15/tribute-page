            <li>
              <span class="year">1872</span>Rizal's father, Francisco Mercado
              Rizal, was exiled to Dapitan, Mindanao, for his alleged
              involvement in the Cavite Mutiny. This event had a profound impact
              on Rizal, and it later inspired him to write the novel Noli Me
              Tangere.

              Tangere, which was an immediate bestseller. The novel was critical
